#### Application Spawn & Goal Overview:

This mini CRUD application was originally started as I was browsing the Australian Skateboarding Community Initiative (ASCi) website (www.autralianskateboarding.com) and I thought this was really poor. As I am currently completing a Udemy Full Stack Web Development Course, I thought re-creating the functionality of this website and making it work somewhat like www.visitnsw.com would be beneficial to ASCi. Essentially it is my aim to create a web app where admin staff can 'Create, Update and Delete' events and allow visitors to view events and submit their ability to attend events.

#### Feature Goals:

* Users can register
* Users can login and authenticate, from there:
  * Users can add new events
  * Users can edit events
  * Users can delete events
    * The above features will be limited to 'Admin' users once security permissions are implemented
  * Users can mark attend on events
    * Once marked, this will show up under their profile in a 'My Events' section.
    * Users can remove their attendance from here.
  * Users can comment on events.
* Events can be:
  * Given catagories
  * Sorted by catagories & date
