### Application Spawn & Goal Overview:

* This mini CRUD application was originally started as I was browsing the Australian Skateboarding Community Initiative (ASCi) website (www.autralianskateboarding.com) and I thought this was really poor. As I am currently completing a Udemy Full Stack Web Development Course, I thought re-creating the functionality of this website and making it work somewhat like www.visitnsw.com would be beneficial to ASCi. Essentially it is my aim to create a web app where admin staff can 'Create, Update and Delete' events and allow visitors to view events and submit their ability to attend events.

### Goals:
